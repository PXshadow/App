Before you Publish your project offically please if at all possible cover your application legally. 
The best way to make sure you comply with the lisences held by OpenFL, Bazzisoft, HaxeExtensions and App would be posting a notice in your Terms of Use. 
In the Terms of Use, you can provide a link containing all relevant information to the MIT license for users to access this information. 
This is also benefical if in the future should you use any additional open source programs you can update your notice.
Notice helps make users aware the underlying framework source code is not entirely yours and credits the appropriate author for the portions of the content you used. 
If you do not post the notice, 
then you will not be legally complying with the MIT lisence.
